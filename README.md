# AUT: www.box.com
###### source: Payonee

### The Goal
The goal of this exercise is to check coding skills, knowledge of relevant test frameworks, testing style and techniques, quality of
code that an applicant can demonstrate. Also, we want to give an impression of what kind of work to expect. The job itself will not
be related to Box.com, and we will not use submitted code in any way other than for the candidateâ€™s application.

### Task description
Develop a Test automation project with functional tests for https://www.box.com functionality - allows to access user's account
and perform some actions. Please write automated tests for at least 3 Scenarios/Test Cases. The tests should be written using
Selenium WebDriver, Maven, Java or JavaScript, TestNG or JUnit. Feel free to use any already registered user, however user
credentials should be parametrized (easy to change). Please describe shortly how to run/configure your project.

##### Mandatory Tests Scenarios to cover
Login/Logout functionality
Create folder functionality
Upload file functionality
